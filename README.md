Sustainable and Data-Driven Vendor Selection

This research paper presents a vendor selection framework that combines traditional procurement criteria with sustainability-focused metrics to support more comprehensive decision-making.

The study goes beyond standard factors such as cost, quality, delivery, and reliability by incorporating environmental considerations including carbon footprint, renewable energy usage, and relevant certifications. A Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) approach is used along with Python-based data processing and a dashboard interface to evaluate and rank vendors.

Key elements covered in the paper:

Integration of sustainability factors with conventional procurement metrics

Use of MCDA for weighted scoring and vendor comparison

Validation using real procurement data

Dashboard implementation with Streamlit

Data visualization for ranking and scenario analysis

The findings indicate that when sustainability metrics are considered alongside traditional criteria, vendors with stronger environmental performance can rank competitively. The proposed framework provides a structured approach for organizations transitioning from cost-based evaluation models to sustainability-aligned procurement practices.
